This directory is for running HAFS forecast 
components with multiple static nests (MSN).

To run the forecast, you need to do a few things:
  1.  Run "init_new_case.sh" to create a working
      directory for your forecast.
  2a. Place your initial conditions data in your 
      new working directory's "data" subdirectory.
  2b. Modify settings_sys.sh, settings_grid.sh,
      settings_chgres.sh, and settings_forecast.sh
      in accordance with your experimental design.
  3.  Modify and MPI-run (i.e., using sbatch) these 
      programs in order:
        - slurm_grid_multi.sh
        - slurm_sfc_multi.sh
        - slurm_chgres.sh
        - slurm_forecast_2nest.sh

This patchwork workflow is still in early stages 
of development and not intended for general use.
